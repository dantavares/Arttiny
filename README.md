# Arttiny
## Cool projects with Attiny built from Arduino IDE

All projects here are compiled and recorded using the Arduino IDE together with the ATtiny libraries and used the internal oscillator set at 1 or 8Mhz with the BOD disabled. I don't use any Attiny other than Attiny85 or 13, but you can try others, the Arduino compiler will inform you if the compiled firmware will be compatible.

Here are the Attiny libraries i use:

ATtiny13:

ATtiny85:

You don't need to buy a recorder to use Attiny, you can do it yourself! Follow the instructions here:

And you will have everything you need.
